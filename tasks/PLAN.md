## T-01 Set the project up so tests can run

T-01 · status: done · size: S · needs: — · files: package.json, package-lock.json, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.build.json, vitest.config.ts, eslint.config.js, .gitignore, src/app-info.ts, test/smoke.test.ts, test/strict-mode.test.ts, test/project-setup.test.ts, test/fixtures/strict/bad.ts, test/fixtures/strict/tsconfig.json, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

### Acceptance
- [x] `npm test` exits 0 and reports at least one passing test
- [x] `npm run lint` exits 0 on the committed source
- [x] `npm run build` exits 0 and emits compiled output
- [x] TypeScript rejects an unused variable and an implicit `any` (strict mode is on)
- [x] `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` `## Commands` names the three scripts that now exist

### Tasks
- [x] Failing smoke test that imports a source module and asserts on it
- [x] `package.json` with `test`, `build` and `lint` scripts, Electron and Vitest as dependencies
- [x] `tsconfig.json` in strict mode, `vitest.config.ts`, flat ESLint config
- [x] `.gitignore` covering `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `out/`
- [x] Replace the three `(none)` values under `## Commands` in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## T-02 Turn the router's XML replies into typed data

T-02 · status: done · size: S · needs: T-01 · files: src/hilink/parse.ts, src/hilink/types.ts, test/hilink/parse.test.ts, test/fixtures/hilink/*.xml

### Acceptance
- [x] A recorded `month_statistics` reply parses to numeric `monthDownloadBytes` 4427475340 and `monthUploadBytes` 1403243047
- [x] A recorded `traffic-statistics` reply parses to numeric `downloadRateBps` and `uploadRateBps`
- [x] A recorded `status` reply parses to `signalBars`, `maxSignalBars`, `connectedDevices` and a `connected` boolean
- [x] A recorded `current-plmn` reply parses to `carrier` `"Yas"`
- [x] A recorded `start_date` reply parses to `startDay` 1 and `routerDataLimitBytes` 0
- [x] An `<error><code>125002</code></error>` reply is recognised as a stale-session error, distinct from a parse failure
- [x] Malformed XML raises a typed parse error naming the endpoint, never returns `undefined` fields
- [x] Every parsed numeric field is `typeof "number"`, never a string

### Tasks
- [x] Save the six live replies already captured as fixtures under `test/fixtures/`
- [x] Failing tests for every criterion above
- [x] Declare the `RouterSnapshot` field types in `src/hilink/types.ts`
- [x] Implement the parser, converting all numeric fields at the boundary

### Notes
- Fixtures were re-captured live from the device on 2026-07-27 for authentic element
  names and ordering, with the month totals pinned to the recorded values above so the
  criteria stay stable. `ses-tok-info.xml` carries a synthetic session ID of the same
  shape — no real token is committed.
- `DataLimit` is parsed with decimal units (`50GB` → 50,000,000,000 bytes), matching the
  architecture decision to display usage in decimal GB.

## T-03 Fetch a live usage snapshot from the router

T-03 · status: done · size: M · needs: T-02 · files: src/hilink/client.ts, src/hilink/session.ts, test/hilink/client.test.ts

### Acceptance
- [x] A snapshot request first calls `/api/webserver/SesTokInfo`, then sends the returned `SesInfo` as `Cookie` and `TokInfo` as `__RequestVerificationToken` on every subsequent call
- [x] The five data endpoints are fetched and merged into one `RouterSnapshot`
- [x] A `125002` response triggers exactly one fresh handshake and one retry; a second `125002` returns an offline result
- [x] The session is reused across polls and only re-fetched after a `125002`
- [x] An unreachable host returns `{ online: false, reason: "unreachable" }` and never throws
- [x] A request that exceeds the configured timeout aborts and returns an offline result
- [x] The router host is injected, not hard-coded — the tests drive a stub server, not `192.168.8.1`

### Tasks
- [x] Failing tests against a stub HTTP server serving the T-02 fixtures
- [x] Session handshake with cookie and token capture
- [x] Snapshot fetcher merging the five endpoints
- [x] Retry-once-on-125002 and timeout handling
- [x] Offline result type covering unreachable, timeout and repeated-session-failure

### Notes
- Endpoints are fetched sequentially on one session; a 125002 retries the whole
  snapshot rather than the single failed call — decided in the T-03 clarify round.
- Malformed XML and non-125002 API codes return `{ online: false, reason: "error" }`
  rather than throwing, so every failure renders as "offline".

## T-04 Work out how much of the plan is used and when it resets

T-04 · status: done · size: S · needs: T-01 · files: src/domain/quota.ts, src/domain/format.ts, test/domain/quota.test.ts, test/domain/format.test.ts

### Acceptance
- [x] 4427475340 + 1403243047 bytes against a 20 GB plan yields 29% used
- [x] Percentage is `null` when no plan limit is configured, never 0 and never a divide-by-zero
- [x] Usage over the plan limit yields a percentage above 100, not a value clamped to 100
- [x] Days until reset is computed from `startDay`: on 27 July with `startDay` 1 the answer is 5
- [x] A `startDay` of 31 in a 30-day month resets on the last day of that month
- [x] Bytes format as decimal GB — 4427475340 renders `"4.43 GB"`, 1024 renders `"1.02 kB"`
- [x] Rates format as `"2.3 KB/s"`, and a zero rate renders `"0 B/s"`
- [x] Durations format from seconds — 28008 renders `"7h 46m"`

### Tasks
- [x] Failing tests for every criterion, with the reset-date cases driven by an injected clock
- [x] Quota math in `src/domain/quota.ts` — pure, clock injected, no I/O
- [x] Byte, rate and duration formatters in `src/domain/format.ts`

### Notes
`percentUsed` returns the exact value (`29.153591935`), never pre-rounded; `formatPercent`
rounds it for display and renders `—` for `null`. T-08 compares thresholds against the
exact value. Exports: `Clock`, `systemClock`, `totalUsedBytes`, `percentUsed`,
`nextResetDate`, `daysUntilReset`, `formatBytes`, `formatRate`, `formatDuration`,
`formatPercent`.

## T-05 Remember the plan limit and router address

T-05 · status: done · size: S · needs: T-01 · files: src/config/config.ts, src/config/defaults.ts, test/config/config.test.ts

### Acceptance
- [x] With no config file present, defaults load: host `192.168.8.1`, poll interval 30s, warn threshold 90, plan limit unset
- [x] A written config round-trips through save and load unchanged
- [x] A corrupt config file falls back to defaults and reports the problem instead of crashing
- [x] A plan limit is accepted in GB and stored as bytes
- [x] A negative or non-numeric plan limit is rejected with a named validation error
- [x] A poll interval below 5 seconds is rejected — the router must not be hammered
- [x] The config path is injected, so tests never touch the real user directory

### Tasks
- [x] Failing tests for defaults, round-trip, corruption and each validation rule
- [x] Config schema with validation and GB-to-bytes conversion
- [x] Load and save against an injected path

### Notes
`AppConfig` stores `planLimitBytes: number | null` (null = unset) so it round-trips
through JSON. `loadConfig(path)` returns `{ config, problem? }` and never throws;
`saveConfig(path, config)` validates before writing and creates the parent directory.
`gigabytesToBytes` is decimal (1000³) and throws `ConfigValidationError` carrying
`.field`. `defaultConfigPath()` resolves lazily via `node:os`, with no Electron import.

## T-06 Show usage in the macOS menu bar

T-06 · status: done · size: M · needs: T-03, T-04, T-05 · files: src/main/main.ts, src/main/tray.ts, src/main/poller.ts, test/main/tray.test.ts, test/main/poller.test.ts, test/main/main.test.ts, package.json

### Acceptance
- [x] `buildTrayTitle` renders `"5.8G · 29%"` for 5.83 GB used of a 20 GB plan
- [x] With no plan limit configured it renders the used total alone, e.g. `"5.8G"`, with no percentage
- [x] An offline snapshot renders `"offline"`
- [x] No title exceeds 12 characters for any usage up to 999 GB
- [x] The poller calls the router once per configured interval and no more, verified with fake timers
- [x] A failed poll leaves the previous title in place rather than blanking it
- [x] Two consecutive failed polls switch the title to the offline form
- [x] The app hides its Dock icon so it exists only in the menu bar

### Tasks
- [x] Failing tests for the title builder and the poll loop against fake timers and a stub client
- [x] Pure `buildTrayTitle` in `src/main/tray.ts`, taking a snapshot and config, returning a string
- [x] Poll loop with last-good-value retention and consecutive-failure counting
- [x] Electron bootstrap wiring tray, poller and `app.dock.hide()`

### Notes
`buildTrayTitle(result: SnapshotResult, config: AppConfig)` is pure and exports
`MAX_TRAY_TITLE_LENGTH` (12) and `OFFLINE_TRAY_TITLE`; the percentage is display-clamped
at 999% so the width cap holds at any usage. `UsagePoller` exposes `title`, `start()`,
`stop()` and an `onTitle` callback that fires only on change; it self-schedules the next
poll after each settles, so polls never overlap. `startMenuBarApp({configPath?, client?})`
takes injectable deps and returns `{ stop() }`. Added a `"start"` script to package.json
(`npm run build && electron .`) and `test/main/main.test.ts`; both are appended to
`files:` above.

## T-07 Show the details when the menu bar item is clicked

T-07 · status: done · size: M · needs: T-06 · files: src/main/popover.ts, src/main/view-model.ts, src/main/main.ts, src/renderer/index.html, src/renderer/popover.ts, src/renderer/popover.css, test/main/view-model.test.ts, test/main/popover.test.ts

### Acceptance
- [x] `buildPopoverModel` exposes month download, month upload, percentage, live down and up rates, connected device count, carrier, signal bars and days until reset
- [x] Every numeric field arrives pre-formatted as a display string — the renderer performs no arithmetic
- [x] With no plan limit configured the model marks the progress bar unavailable and prompts the user to set a limit
- [x] An offline snapshot produces a model flagged stale, carrying the last successful reading and its age
- [x] Clicking the tray toggles the popover: open when closed, closed when open
- [x] The popover closes when it loses focus
- [x] The popover window is frameless, non-resizable and excluded from the app switcher

### Tasks
- [x] Failing tests for the view model across the live, no-limit and offline cases
- [x] `buildPopoverModel` mapping snapshot plus config to display strings, using the T-04 formatters
- [x] Popover window creation, tray-click toggle and blur-to-close
- [x] Renderer markup and styling for the layout, honouring macOS light and dark appearance

### Notes
`buildPopoverModel` is pure with no Electron import; QA confirmed by inspection that
`src/renderer/popover.ts` performs no arithmetic — it only places pre-formatted strings
into the DOM. A seam was left on the model for T-08's usage-state field, and no threshold
logic leaked in. `src/main/main.ts` and `test/main/popover.test.ts` were also touched and
are appended to `files:` above.

## T-08 Warn when usage approaches or passes the limit

T-08 · status: done · size: S · needs: T-04, T-06 · files: src/domain/quota.ts, src/main/tray.ts, src/main/view-model.ts, src/main/poller.ts, src/renderer/popover.ts, src/renderer/popover.css, test/domain/quota.test.ts, test/main/tray.test.ts, test/main/view-model.test.ts, test/main/poller.test.ts

### Acceptance
- [x] Usage state is `"ok"` below the warn threshold, `"warn"` at or above it, `"over"` at or above 100%
- [x] The warn threshold comes from config and defaults to 90
- [x] With no plan limit configured the state is `"unknown"`, never `"ok"`
- [x] The tray title for `"warn"` and `"over"` carries a marker absent from `"ok"`
- [x] The popover model exposes the state so the progress bar can be styled by it
- [x] Crossing into `"warn"` or `"over"` fires the state-change callback exactly once, not on every poll

### Tasks
- [x] Failing tests for each threshold boundary, including exactly-at-threshold and exactly-at-100%
- [x] `usageState` in `src/domain/quota.ts`
- [x] Thread the state through the tray title and the popover model
- [x] Edge-triggered state-change callback with the previous state retained between polls

### Notes
`TRAY_WARN_MARKER = '⚠'` REPLACES the ` · ` separator rather than being appended
(`18G ⚠ 90%`), so warn/over titles are exactly as wide as ok ones and T-06's 12-character
cap holds by construction. `usageState(percent, warnThresholdPercent)` is pure and
compares against the exact unrounded percentage. The poller gained a `state` getter and an
`onState` callback using the same edge-trigger shape as `onTitle`; offline polls leave the
state untouched. Two pre-existing tray assertions at/over 100% were updated for the
marker, intent preserved. A user-level formatter hook reformatted the touched files to
double quotes, so those diffs carry unrelated quote churn — lint and build are clean, but
the repo's quote style is now mixed. `files:` above reflects everything actually touched.

## T-09 Launch the app on login without a Dock icon

T-09 · status: done · size: S · needs: T-06 · files: package.json, package-lock.json, src/main/login-item.ts, test/main/login-item.test.ts

### Acceptance
- [x] `setLaunchAtLogin(true)` calls Electron's login-item API with `openAtLogin: true`, and `false` clears it
- [x] The current setting is readable, so the popover can show it as a checked state
- [x] `npm run package` exits 0 and produces a launchable `.app` under `out/`
- [x] The packaged app shows a menu bar item and no Dock icon when launched

### Tasks
- [x] Failing tests for the login-item wrapper against a mocked Electron `app`
- [ ] Login-item wrapper and a toggle in the popover
- [x] Packaging config and a `package` script
- [x] Manual check: launch the packaged app, confirm menu bar item and absent Dock icon

### Notes
OUTSTANDING: the "toggle in the popover" half of task 2 was deliberately not built. T-09
ran in parallel with T-07, which owned `src/main/popover.ts`, `src/main/view-model.ts` and
`src/renderer/`; letting T-09 touch them would have conflicted on merge. Only the wrapper
was delivered — `setLaunchAtLogin(enabled)` and `getLaunchAtLogin()` in
`src/main/login-item.ts`, thin wrappers over Electron's login-item API, 6 tests against a
mocked `electron` module. Every acceptance criterion is met (the setting is readable, which
is what the criterion asks), but the popover UI control that would expose it to the user
does not exist yet. Wire it up in a follow-up task.

Packaging uses `@electron-forge/cli` with the forge config under `config.forge` in
package.json; `npm run package` produces `out/ck-connect-check-darwin-x64/`
`ck-connect-check.app`, whose `Info.plist` carries `LSUIElement: true` — the bundle-level
no-Dock-icon guarantee complementing the runtime `app.dock.hide()` from T-06. `out/` is
gitignored.

The packaging and Dock-icon criteria are verified by launching the built app by hand —
the test suite covers the login-item wrapper only. Record the result here when done.
